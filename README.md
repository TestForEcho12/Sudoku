# Sudoku
A script to solve Sudoku puzzles.

I was motivated to write this after watching this video on MIT OpenCourseware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auK3PSZoidc

In this lecture the primary means of solving the puzzle was brute force, recursion. I wanted to flip that around and solve as much of the puzzle as I could with logic, then use the brute force method as the last option.
